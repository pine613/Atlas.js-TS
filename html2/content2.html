<h3>Settings</h3>
I'd like to introduce you the initial settings before the game loop.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
var game = new App();

game.load("hero.png","bgm.mp3");
/*
load the assets you use in your apps
    */
game.naming(["hero.png","hero"],["bgm.mp3","bgm"]);
/*
name the assets you loaded
    */
game.centerize();
/*
put the game screen at the center of the browser screen.
*/
game.changeQuality(width,height);
/*
set the horizontal and vertical resolution of the game.
*/
game.changeSize(width,height);
/*
set the size of the screen.
*/
game.keySet(buttonA,buttonB);
/*
bind the keys
buttonA to game.key.a
buttonB to game.key.b

if the buttonA is pushed
game.key.a == true
if the buttonA is released
game.key.a == false
*/
game.fps = 30;
/*
set the fps of the game
*/
