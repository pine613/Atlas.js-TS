<h3>EventListener</h3>
Atlas.js has the 3 methods which allows you to register following Eventlisters.<br />
Like,<br />game.touchStart<br />game.touchMove<br />game.touchEnd<br />
game.touchStart is the function, which is called when you start touching the screen<br />
game.touchMove is the function, which is called when you are moving the carsor or fingers on the screen<br />
game.touchEnd is the function, which is called when you finished touching the screen.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
game.touchStart(function(e){
var obj = game.getPosition(e);
console.log("your touching point is("+obj.x+","+obj.y+")");
});
</pre>
Like above you can get the touched point<br />
via game.getPosition(e)
