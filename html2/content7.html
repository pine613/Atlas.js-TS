<h3>Others</h3>
Atlas.js has other many useful methods.<br />
I'll let you know.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
game.isMobile;
/*
This is property.
it judges client's device.
if client's device is Mobile, it returns true,else returns false。
 */
game.drawText(x, y, string, col,font);
/*
Write down the string"string" with color"col",font"font"
at the point(x,y)
*/
game.drawBox(x, y, sizeX, sizeY, col, alpha);
/*
Draw the box with size(sizeX,sizeY),color"col"and transparency"alpha"
at the point(x,y)
*/
game.getRand(min,max);
/*
it returns random integer from "min" to "max"
*/
game.field;
/*
it is canvas element,
From this, you can manipulate the canvas element.
Example
game.field.width = 500;
set the screen size of game as 500
But,in this case,I recomend you to use the following method
game.changeSize(width,height);
